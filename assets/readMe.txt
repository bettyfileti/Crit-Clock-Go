Next Steps:
1. Work on design. Style the footer and work out responsive/sizing.
2. Add bonus time functionality.
3. Allow option of running timer here?
4. Option of inputing names and sorting by random? 
5. Collaborative queue that multiple users can add their names to?
6. Favicon and maybe some lite graphics?
7. Show calculator as inactive, until times have been input?
8. Make sure you can check/uncheck by using enter, when tabbing.
